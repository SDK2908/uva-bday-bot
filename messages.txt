Happy Birthday, my love — the first of 24 tiny things I adore about you.
You are the softest, fiercest person I know.
You make the funniest faces — that laugh is mine forever.
I love how you say my name.
Being with you feels like coming home.
Your smile is brighter than morning coffee.
I think about you in the quiet moments.
You make everything better just by being you.
Little memory: you dancing in the kitchen — I melt.
Midday reminder: you are seen, loved, treasured.
You are stronger than you think and softer than you feel.
If I could, I’d freeze time for moments like you.
You are my favorite everything.
I keep replaying your laugh in my head.
You deserve wild, gentle love all the time.
I’m proud of you for being you.
If I had stars, I’d send you one for every thought of you.
You’re my safe place and my greatest adventure.
I cherish the way you love the world.
I wish I could hold you right now.
A little secret: I fall for you again and again.
I want to give you the moon tonight — but this will do for now.
Sleep soon, my love. See you in my dreams.
One last whisper — I love you more than words.
